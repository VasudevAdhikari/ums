# Noticeboard Django App

The **Noticeboard** app is a modular Django application for managing, reviewing, and displaying institutional notices. It provides a robust workflow for notice creation, approval, and publication, ensuring that only authorized and relevant information reaches users. The app is designed for easy integration into larger Django projects, supporting both administrative control and user-friendly notice consumption.

## Data Model

- **Notice**
  - `title`: Title of the notice.
  - `content`: Main body/content of the notice.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of creation.
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update.
  - `status`: State of the notice (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`).
  - `author`: (Optional) Reference to the user who created the notice.

---

## Workflows

### 1. Notice Creation
- Authorized users access the **Manage Post** interface (`manage_post.html`).
- Submit a new notice, which is saved with a "pending" status.

### 2. Notice Approval
- Admins access the **Pending Notices** interface (`pending.html`).
- Review, approve, or reject pending notices.
- Approved notices become visible to all users.

### 3. Notice Display
- All users access the **Noticeboard** (`noticeboard.html`).
- Only approved notices are listed, typically ordered by date or priority.

### 4. Notice Management
- Admins can edit or delete notices as needed.
- JavaScript enhances the experience with validation and dynamic updates.

## Security & Permissions

- **Role-Based Access:** Only authorized users can create or manage notices; only admins can approve/reject.
- **Input Validation:** Both backend and frontend validation for notice content.
- **Audit Trail:** Optionally, track who created, edited, or approved each notice.

## Usage

1. **Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`** in Django settings:
    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'noticeboard',
    ]
    ```

2. **Include URLs** in project’s `urls.py`:
    ```python
    path('noticeboard/', include('noticeboard.urls')),
    ```

3. **Run migrations** to set up the database tables:
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4. **Access the noticeboard** and management interfaces via the configured URLs.

## Customization & Extensibility

- **Templates** can be extended or overridden to match project’s branding.
- **Static assets** (CSS/JS) can be customized for additional interactivity or styling.
- **Model fields** can be extended for richer notice metadata (attachments, expiry dates, etc.).
- **Signals** or hooks can be added for notifications (e.g., email users when a new notice is published).
